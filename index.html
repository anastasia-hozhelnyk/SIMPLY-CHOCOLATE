            <ul>
                <li>
                    Heat the milk in a saucepan without bringing it to a boil. Add sugar and cocoa powder.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At the same time, prepare a water bath. Melt the butter on it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Mix" the milk mixture and already liquid butter. Mix thoroughly with a silicone spatula so that the
                    mass becomes
                    uniform and silky.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat the mixture over low heat, letting it barely boil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour the chocolate into special containers (can be replaced with ice molds). Allow to cool and
                    harden.
                </li>
